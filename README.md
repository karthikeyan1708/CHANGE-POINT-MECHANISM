# CHANGE-POINT-MECHANISM

The project here is developed to synthesis and analyse a given mechanism.
Here it is done using a well-developed app.This app can differentiate change point mechanism from other mechanisms and also identifies the type of change point mechanism. Then it proceeds to simulate the working of the mechanism. The app helps to analyse the given mechanism based on velocity analysis and acceleration analysis and produces a plot for the analysis. The development of the app is based on the synthesis and analysis topics of this semester.
